"Nos" is an interesting, yet deliberate word. In many languages such as Spanish, French, and Portuguese, it means "our". This photo album app, "Nos Album", contains memories that is shared between 2 people: The person who you are today, and the person who you were in the past. This app acts as a medium between time so that the present you can look around and re-live the moments that once happened, ensuring that the nostalgic feeling burns within you.
